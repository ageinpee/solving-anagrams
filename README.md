# solving-anagrams
solves anagrams in the german language with 4-12 letters length. Due to the complexity (n!) of a words permutations only up to 11 letters length can be computed in a reasonable amount of time.
In this script different algorithms and datastructures were used to achive a optimal performance. The permutations are checked with multiple thousand german words to get a correct solution.
